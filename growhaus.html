            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>While the residents of Denver are primarily aware of healthy foods, there are still counties of Denver that experience food insecurity, which is the state of being without reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food. This specific area in Denver (80216) is severely underserved by grocers and produce retailers that provide local, sustainably-sourced produce at an affordable cost.

                
            <br/><br/>GrowHaus Denver was designed to achieve affordable, sustainable, and fresh groceries to its Denver community. We have observed that our client’s current webpage isn’t converting visitors to donars and it is a complicated site to navigate to if you are a recipient of a foodbox. This resulted to a lack of funds and confused beneficiaries who are left to call the team to order their foodbox instead of going through the online process, creating long waits on the telephone lines. </p>

            <hr class="gh">
            <p>As the lead project manager and researcher on the team, I led the process of conducting user interviews, synthesis sessions, brainstorming sessions before arriving at solutions. 

            I advocated for attention to detail on flows and sections and worked on iterating smooth interactions between each page. It was important that when you are on any page, there was intention behind the design and why the user was there.

                
            <br/><br/>Additionally, managing the project, I conducted stand-up meetings to ensure our team met deadlines and criteria. I built the interactions on the  and interactive prototypes in both XD and Invision for user feedback and testing.
        
            <br/><br/>After the group project finished, I refined the design on my own, conducted more testing sessions, and iterated the design for learning purposes. </p>

            <p>To better understand the technology issues that Growhaus faces, I reached out to  Growhaus'  Director of Business, Nathan, to help us understand their pain points, what is going well, and what they hope to achieve.</p>

            <br/><br/><p>Now, we had to discover and understand how a nonprofit website communicates its mission and services as well as tactics to encourage website visitors to take action by donating or volunteering.<br/><br/><br/>We  interviewed around 10 peole who have engaged, donated, or recieved support from one or more Nonprofits in the last 3 years. We found:

            br/><br/> <ul>
                <li>Users need an easy call to action to feel engaged with a non-profit</li><br/>
                <li>Users want to see the mission statement and who to contact on the homepage</li><br/>
                <li>Users want to see where donations are going with real anecdotes and testimonials</li>
     </ul><br/>

     <br/><p>We administered 8 usability tests on the Growhaus Website on three platforms - mobile, web, and iPad.</p><br/>

        <img src="images/findings from survey.png" alt="Me" class="2">
    </div>

            <br/><br/><p>Because of Growhaus' hard to find Call To Actions, hidden mission statement, and lack of easy to find resources to deem their credibility, visitors do not stay long on the Growhaus website, resulting in a loss opportunity to gain more donations for foodboxes for residents of 80212. <br/><br/><br/><br/>

                <p>All this information helped us shape our problem statement.</p>

            <p>We chose the types of color pallette we'd want to be represented for GrowHaus<br/><br/>

            We also built a UI Style Tile of what types of colors, typography, iconography, and graphics we'd like to stay within the frame of<br/><br/></p>

            <br/><br/><p>So, here’s how we pieced the research together and built our story board. How many of you scroll social media and learn something new? 

                <br/><br/>Like many of you, our storyboard shows the Vincent in a scenario where he learns about Growhaus

                <br/><br/>Vincent was scrolling through his social media account, where he saw a post from a friend about receiving a foodbox from GrowHaus, and praise of the organization. Vincent wanted to learn more about GrowHaus and searched for its social media account, where he found a link to GrowHaus, Website. From there, he learned about the organization and the impact it has on the community, and decides not only to become a recurring donor, but purchases a full-cost foodbox for himself and his family. </p> <br/><br/>

            </div>
            <p>As a team, we drew out sketches and compared and discussed, the different features and brand look of each of our drawings<br/><br/>

                When creating our low-fidelity wireframe, we have all agreed on highlighting information pertaining to: the coronavirus response from the GrowHaus, the ability to order or donate a foodbox, and COMMUNICATING the growhaus call to action. From here, we felt that the remaining necessary content for the website would fall into place. <br/><br/>
                
            We then created this preliminary wireframes.<br/><br/></p>

                <img src="images/lofi.png" alt="Me" class="2">
            </div><br/><br/>

            <p>After having evaluated our work on the low-fidelity wireframe in Adobe XD, we were able to incorporate slight changes to the wireframe, such as hero images and a flowmap illustrating for users how their contributions to the organisation reaches families in need. 

                From there, we began to incorporate many UI elements to the design, which included a colour scheme and typography that we had developed for the product earlier in the design process.

            <h3>Usability Feedback & Revised Designs </h3>

            <p>Our Usability testing focused on three objectives: 
            
                <br/> <ul>
                    <li>User's ability to order a foodbox</li>
                    <li>User's understanding of the purpose of the GrowHaus</li>
                    <li>User's ability to donate a foodbox </li>
                    
         </ul></p><br/><br/>

            <div class="box1a">
                <img src="images/usability testing.png" alt="Me" class="2"><br/><br/>
            </div>
            <p>We found we still had a lot of work to do on the user flow for donating and ordering a foodbox. People were still a little lost on where they were on the screens and did not feel the brand was consistent on each page. <br/><br/></p>

            <p>Since the goal of our redesign is to help visitors of the site have an easier time donating or ordering their foodbox, we decided to completely redo our designs and start from scratch provided the feedback. We focused our attention and scaled back on what the process would look like when ordering a food from each intentional interaction. What would the users be thinking? What types of small details will help them feel like they are going in the right direction?<br/><br/></p>

            <h3>Hi-Fi Prototype (English & Spanish) </h3><br/><br/>

            <p>As we have just touched on, feedback from users testing has proved to be rather important in formulating our final prototype, first for the mobile version, then for the desktop version of our prototypes.</p><br/><br/>
            
            <p>Among all visual and experiential changes we have made in iterating on our original wireframes, we as a group had focused our efforts on changes regarding:<br/> <ul>
                <li>Building out the "order a foodbox" workflow</li>
                <li>Cleaning up and iterating upon the user flow</li>
                <li>Building more "timeline" elements that display visibility of system status </li>

            <p>A key feature we would like to demonstrate first is the ability to easily switch between the English and Spanish language versions of the site. This is a key feature that we identified as many of the beneficiaries of the GrowHaus are spanish-speaking families.

            <p>Further, we have a comprehensive “about” page, which is both easy to find, and includes information that we understand from testing that  users want presented to them when looking for the “about” page of a non-profit website, including the mission statement, meeting team members of the organization, and a news or blog area to keep up to date with the GrowHaus. <br/>

            <hr class="gh">

            <p>We as a team are planning on presenting our final prototypes to the GrowHaus, and in fact have a meeting with Nathan, the business manager from GrowHaus, already on the books.. We hope to receive helpful contextual feedback on our designs, and are willing to allow the organisation to use our designs in further iterations of their website</p><br/><br/>

            <p>As we look toward the future, we believe that we are able to more easily tackle design projects of this calibre as a team, having understood the vast amount of empathy involved in communicating a charitable organisation’s mission with the world in a friendly and prominent manner. </p>
