            <p>

                While consumers are aware of food expiration, working professionals feel as if they are too busy to consistently track their food in their kitchen. Sell by dates and expirations are not considered relevant due to their prior experience of eating foods past their best by dates and not feeling sick.  

                <br/><br/>We want to build an app that helps the user keep track  expiration dates for the food they purchase and bring into their home.

            <hr class="gh">
            <p>As the lead project manager and researcher on the team, I led the process of conducting user interviews, synthesis sessions, brainstorming sessions before arriving at solutions. 

            I advocated for the user and how our designs need to be data-driven and human-centered.

                
            <br/><br/>Additionally, managing the project, I conducted stand-up meetings to ensure our team met deadlines and criteria.
        
            <br/><br/>After the group project finished, I am currently designing on my own, conducted more testing sessions, and iterated the design for learning purposes. </p>

            </div>
            <p>During the research phase, we sought to understand how working professionals cook, track, and prioritize their food. We also needed to uncover the needs and frustrations of our target user when they track their food to better understand how to build a solution. </p> 

            <br/><br/> 
            <h3>Research Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand to what extent working professionals, who cook, make purchasing decisions regarding the lifespan of the food they buy.</li><br/>
                <li>Understand how working professionals decide which foods to cook during the week</li><br/>
                <li>Understand to what extent do working professionals track the expiration dates on the food in their kitchens.</li>
     </ul><br/>

        
            
            <br/><h3>Primary Research - Interviews</h3><br/><p>To better understand the perspective of our target user, we interviewed 9 active people who regularly shop at grocery stores. 
            </p> 

            <h3>Research Assumptions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tracking food is used by your memory and people lack tech resources to track their foods. </li><br/>
                <li>Users are frustrated when they throw away spoiled food. </li><br/>
                <li>People would prefer to eat all their purchases instead of throwing it out.</li>
     </ul><br/>

                <img src="images/kkaff.png" alt="Me" class="2">
            </div><br/>

            <p>After completion of the interviews, we put the responses on sticky notes and clustered them into an Affinity Map. This process helped us organize and synthesize our interviewees responses and user themes we found. 
            </p> 

            <br/>
            <h3>Key Findings</h3> 
            <ul>
                <li>Users use their senses of touch and smell to determine if their food is still good.</li><br/>
                <li>Users do not consider sell-by dates relevant and they do not track expiration dates.</li><br/>
                <li>Users track their food based on their memory. </li>
     </ul><br/>

                <li>There are not that many competitors in the space that track food on a mobile app. This showed us an opportunity to create a mobile app to improve the efficiency of tracking food in the kitchen.</li>
                <li>Build an easier flow for beneficiaries to request a foodbox or recieve</li>
                <li>Connecting to a grocery store API will save time when uploading or saving food in your profile. Additionally, scanning the barcode of the food seemed to be a user favorite feature. </li>
                <li>There are food management apps, and weight loss apps, but no apps that track how long food has been in your kitchen.</li>

            <br/><br/><p>Building on what we learned about our user through our research, a clear story was becoming evident. The storyboard shows the anticipated ideal user in a scenario where Kitchen Keeper will aid in keeping food fresh and unwasted. 

            <br/><br/><ul>
                <li> Starts Her Day</li>
                <li>Food was bad</li>
                <li>Goes to buy More </li>
                <li>Learns about Kitchen Keeper </li>
                <li>Starts Using Kitchen Keeper</li>

            <h3>User Flow</h3><br/><br/>


            <br/><br/><p>When we ideated our user flow, we considered how our users may utilize our app we thought of three main information points.

           </p> <br/><br/><br/><ul>
                <li>Onboarding, need to be intuitive and informational to understand the unique nature of our app</li>
                <li>The adding and removing of products in an efficient manner so users will not feel burdened.</li>
                <li>Notifications that are timely and relevant to the users needs as well as an option to share information with others in the household. </li><br/>

            <h3>Usability Feedback & Revised Designs </h3>

            <p>We conducted 9 user testsThe participants were given 4 scenarios each with a task to complete. Our Usability testing focused on three objectives: 
            
                <br/> <ul>
                    <li>Onboard</li>
                    <li>Add an Item</li>
                    <li>Remove an Item </li>
                    <li>Find your grocery list </li>
                    
         </ul></p><br/><br/>

            
            <p>From our testing we concluded that our onboarding needed more clarification. There was concern about manual input of information when adding an Item and we found an easier way to remove products from the  application. <br/><br/></p>

            <p>Among all visual and experiential changes we have made in iterating on our original wireframes, we as a group had focused our efforts on changes regarding:<br/> <ul>
                <li>Onboarding the user</li>
                <li>Adding / Removing food item</li>
                <li>Setting notifications</li>

            <h2> Future Steps </h2>
            <hr class="gh">

            <p>If our team had more time, we would work on detailing the notifications,  this would allow our users to customize the notifications for their needs. We have also been exploring the idea of fully rolling out the “scan the barcode” of the food item feature to streamline the upload of the app. </p><br/><br/>

            <p>With our group dynamic we were able to collaborate on all aspects of the project. Ideation, creation, testing and revisions. This allowed us to better understand the entire process while we discussed options, different approaches and found our way. We believe we have a better understanding of the process thanks to this group project. The more we talked about our app idea to other people, the more we realized how necessary this app is. It became apparent that the majority of the folks we talked to used memory to keep track of their food, which seems so archaic in our tech-revolving world.  </p>
